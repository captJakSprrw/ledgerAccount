This is just a journal for developing a cli programme called ledgerAccount which was requested by one of my friends.
I am basically trying to make something useful out of my coding knowledge and this project can be seen as a practice project.

Description:
------------

Just a programme to replace the physical ledger of the shops which keep the record of sales and expenditures of the shop.

Expectations from the version 1 of this programme.
---------------------------------------------------

- keep record of sales.
- keep record of money lent to any person with date and time (seperate accounts of customers should me made).
- should be able to provide with the full detail of any customer's history.
- should be able to comeup with the names of customers having dues in descending order when requested.
