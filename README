This is just a journal for developing a cli programme called ledgerAccount which was requested by one of my friends.
I am basically trying to make something useful out of my coding knowledge and this project can be seen as a practice project.

Description:
------------

Just a programme to replace the physical ledger of the shops which keep the record of sales and expenditures of the shop.

Expectations from the version 1 of this programme.
---------------------------------------------------

- keep record of sales.
- keep record of money lent to any person with date and time (seperate accounts of customers should me made).
- should be able to provide with the full detail of any customer's history.
- (should be able to comeup with the names of customers having dues in descending order when requested.) 
        {postponed to version 2}

interface (cli)
---------------

* main menu :

- The programme should open with a logo.
- welcome note will get printed on the screen.
- password is asked along with forget password? and reset password option.
- then some options will be displayed on the screen such as:
    - enter customer menu using credentials of customer (mobile number).
    - print the names of all the customers along with their balance.
    - print today's transaction.
    - print the transaction history of some specific date.

* customer menu: (old customers)

- enter any new transaction.
- view older transactions.
- view balance.
- edit credentials.

* customer menu: (new customer)

- enter name
- enter age (optional)
- enter address
- enter email address (optional)
